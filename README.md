# Notes
* Different kinds of cyclotrons
* Different kinds of beams
* Neutrons have a half life of around 10 hours, they will decay into stable hydrogen.
* The spot (x, y) on the "board" (chart of nuclides) determines the next game state (such as the decay branches).
* proton -> neutron -> heavy ion upgrades
